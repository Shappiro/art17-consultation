Comment on data sheet info
--------------------------

An authenticated user can add comments to a data sheet info record. The same
restriction as for conclusion comments is imposed: an user can add a single
comment for a selection (period, name, bio-region). Once the comment added, the
user can edit/delete/undelete it.
Comments are added by clicking the Add comment button, that exists on the page
only if a comment hasn't been previously added for that selection.
After filling in the comment textarea, the user is expected to submit the
comment or cancel the operation.

    * undelete

* other users' comments:

    * mark as read
    * mark as unread

Introduction
============

Anybody is able to view the data as provided by Member States as well as the
assessments that are finalised by the ETC/BD before the start of the
consultation period.

The available data is organized into two periods:

* 2001-2006, which gathers historical data from the specified period and
  presents it to the user in a readonly mode;
* 2007-2012, the current period, that accepts user corrections and comments.


Biogeographical assessments at EU 27 level
==========================================

Species/Habitat assessments
---------------------------

All the assessments and the progress of ETC/BD work on assessing the
conservation status at biogeographical level, can be seen by following the
“Species/Habitat assessments” link, under the “Biogeographical assessments at
EU 27 level” section, that will open the following page:

The default period for displaying data is 2007-2012, but it can be changed
using the “Period...” selectbox.
By selecting a group and a conclusion type (overall assessment, range, future
prospects, etc.) a view with all the assessments for the
species/habitat types pertaining to the chosen group and corresponding
biogeographical regions is provided.
Users with administrator role have two additional filtering options: they can
view assessments added by a certain user (using the “Assessor...” selectbox)
and, also, they can switch between a detailed/elementary view (by
checking/unchecking the “Details...” checkbox)

Each cell contains a series of information: the decision for that assessment,
the method used for the selected conclusion type and three numbers that show:
unread comments for conclusions introduced by the current user, unread comments
for all conclusions and unread comments for data sheet info. There is also a
piece of more detailed information in the cell tooltip (visible at mouseover).
The cell background shows the conclusion of the assessment for the selected
conclusion type and the possible options are presented in the Legend above the
table.

By clicking on a cell, the corresponding “Species/Habitat data summaries” page
will be opened.

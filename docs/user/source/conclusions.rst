EU Biogeographical assessment and proposed corrections
======================================================

Add assessments
---------------

All registered users can propose corrections to the automatic assessments by
adding a manual assessment on the Species/Habitat data summaries page.
The user is allowed to add only one record for each period, subject and region.
In order to add an assessment a bio-region must be selected.

All users add conclusions using roughly the same form, with a few exceptions:

* NAT user can add a conclusion only for his country;
* ETC user can add a conclusion only for EU27;
* STK and ADM have an additional MS selectbox, and can select any Member State.

Edit assessments
----------------

Assessments can be updated by accessing the Edit Assessment (Propose correction
for STA users) button visible after clicking the assessor's name.
All registered users can edit their own assessments; all assessment fields can
be modified.
ETC and ADM users can also edit other user's assessments, but they can only
change favourable reference values.

Introduction
============

Anybody is able to view the data as provided by Member States as well as the
assessments that are finalised by the ETC/BD before the start of the
consultation period.

The available data is organized into two periods:

* 2001-2006, which gathers historical data from the specified period and
  presents it to the user in a readonly mode;
* 2007-2012, the current period, that accepts user corrections and comments.


Biogeographical assessments at EU 27 level
==========================================

Species/Habitat assessments
---------------------------

All the assessments and the progress of ETC/BD work on assessing the
conservation status at biogeographical level, can be seen by following the
“Species/Habitat assessments” link, under the “Biogeographical assessments at
EU 27 level” section, that will open the following page:

.. figure

The default period for displaying data is 2007-2012, but it can be changed
using the “Period...” selectbox.
By selecting a group and a conclusion type (overall assessment, range, future
prospects, etc.) a view with all the assessments for the
species/habitat types pertaining to the chosen group and corresponding
biogeographical regions is provided.
Users with administrator role have two additional filtering options: they can
view assessments added by a certain user (using the “Assessor...” selectbox)
and, also, they can switch between a detailed/elementary view (by
checking/unchecking the “Details...” checkbox)

Each cell contains a series of information: the decision for that assessment,
the method used for the selected conclusion type and three numbers that show:
unread comments for conclusions introduced by the current user, unread comments
for all conclusions and unread comments for data sheet info. There is also a
piece of more detailed information in the cell tooltip (visible at mouseover).
The cell background shows the conclusion of the assessment for the selected
conclusion type and the possible options are presented in the Legend above the
table.

By clicking on a cell, the corresponding “Species/Habitat data summaries” page
will be opened.

Species/Habitat data summaries
------------------------------

The data summary sheet for species/habitat conservation status provides an
overview per biogeographical region.

.. figure

The default period for displaying data is 2007-2012, but it can be changed
using the “Period...” selectbox.
After choosing a group, the “Name...” selectbox will be populated with all the
species/habitat type names belonging to that group. The selection of a
species/habitat type name is mandatory for filtering, while the selection of a
bio-region is optional.

After pressing the “Filter” button a page similar to the one below appears:

.. figure

The table is made of three main sections:

* Treated data from Member States reports
* Automatic Assessments (hidden by default; the user can view information in
  this section by pressing Show)
* EU Biogeographical assessment and proposed corrections

The buttons above the table open corresponding pages in pop-up windows:

* Data sheet info (view/edit data sheet info, add comments)
* Audit trail (view/edit audit trail)
* Map (show the reports from the countries on a map)

Biogeographical assessments at Member State level
=================================================

Species/Habitat assessments
---------------------------

This page provides a view similar to the “Species/Habitat data summaries”,
having the option to refine the query by country instead of species/habitat
name.

By clicking the species/habitat type name, a popup window with the original
data is opened. The map view can be accessed through the link on the region
name.

Activity logs
=============

The activity logs page provides to the authenticated user a view with recent
conclusions added by users and recent comments for these conclusions.

The user can switch between the Species/Habitat view by clicking the desired
tab.

The dates, both for comments and conclusions, are links to the “EU
Biogeographical assessment and proposed corrections” section for the
species/habitat and region selected.

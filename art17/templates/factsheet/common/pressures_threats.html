    <h2>Main pressures and threats reported by Member States</h2>
  </header>

  <p>Member States were asked to report the 20 most important threats and
  pressures using an agreed hierarchical list which can be found on the
  <a href="http://bd.eionet.europa.eu/activities/Reporting/Article_17/reference_portal">
  Article 17 Reference Portal</a>. Pressures are activities which are currently
  having an impact on the {{ subject }} and threats are activities expected to
  have an impact in the near future. Pressures and threats were ranked in three
  classes ‘high, medium and low importance’; the tables below only show threats
  and pressures classed as ‘high’, for some {{ subject }} there were less than
  ten threats or pressures reported as highly important.</p>
